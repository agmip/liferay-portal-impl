## Start your application server with the system property
## "system.properties.load" set to true to load the external file called
## system.properties. This is given as a convenient way to ensure all properties
## are set for deployment. When the server starts, the portal will load
## system.properties and then system-ext.properties.
##
## Start your application server with the system property
## "system.properties.final" set to true if the properties of system.properties
## override all similar command line properties. If set to false, the properties
## of system.properties will be set if and only if those properties are not
## currently set.
##
## Some application servers require you to set the "file.encoding" and
## "user.timezone" on startup regardless of system.properties because the
## application server reads these properties before system.properties is ever
## loaded.

    # Java uses the underlying operating system to generate images. If you are

    # will not know how to generate images and you'll get lots of nasty
    # exceptions. Setting this property to true will fix that. Sometimes this
    # property cannot be set dynamically when the server starts and you'll need
    # to edit your start script to include this as a system property.

## String Bundler
##

    #
    # Set this property to tell StringBundler when to use a recycled char[] to
    # do an unsafe String creation. The newly created String's immutable
    # property is only maintained during current request scope so that the
    # char[] could be reused by other Strings. This means the old String's
    # content will change. This is safe as long as the old Strings die before
    # the request finishes. This feature introduces risky conditions, so please
    # use it with caution. The benefit is that it can improve GC significantly
    # by reducing large char[] creation.
    #
    # For example, the contents of a page are ultimately represented by a
    # String's char[] which could be several hundred KBs. This can be a heavy
    # burden for the GC. The String is also guaranteed to be freed before the
    # request finishes processing. These Strings are perfect for using this
    # feature to gain performance improvements.
    #
    # Set a value larger than 0 to enable this feature when using StringBundler
    # with an output length longer than the specified value. A reasonable value
    # is 32768 (32 kb) or 65536 (64 kb). The best value depends on how the
    # portal is used.

    # Set this property to tell StringBundler when to use a ThreadLocal buffer
    # to build the output its String. The buffer is referred by SoftReference, so
    # it will be forcibly removed by the GC when memory is nearly exhausted. It
    # should be set to a high value so that the accessing to ThreadLocal is
    # balanced by the savings in garbage collection. Setting it to too low of a
    # value may actually do more harm than good.
