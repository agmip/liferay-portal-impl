/**
 * Stores the permissions assigned to roles under permissions version 6. A
 * resource permission gives a role the ability to perform a set of actions on
 * certain resources.
 *
 * <p>
 * The type of resource a permission applies to is specified by the
 * <code>name</code> attribute. It will either be the numeric ID of a portlet,
 * or the fully qualified class name of a model (such as a layout or document
 * library folder).
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * These permissions can apply in one of four scopes: company, group,
 * group-template, or individual. The scope of a permission determines how
 * broadly it applies to resources in the portal. Company scope is the broadest,
 * and grants a user with the role permissions for every resource of the type
 * within the company. Likewise, group scope gives users with the role
 * permissions for every resource within the specified group, and individual
 * scope only applies to a single resource of the type. Group-template scope is
 * similar to group scope, except that it does not automatically apply to a
 * specific group. A user must be a member of a group (generally either a site
 * or an organization), and they must have been given the role within that group
 * before they are granted its permissions.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Note: Lacking permission to perform an action on a resource at one scope does
 * not necessarily mean that a role does not have permission to perform that
 * action. For instance, a message boards moderator role will not have
 * individual scope permissions to edit every post, but it will have edit
 * permissions at the group or company level, which is sufficient. Every scope
 * must be checked.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * The scope of the resource permission also determines the meaning of the
 * <code>primKey</code> attribute. Its different uses are listed below:
 * </p>
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li>
 * Company scope - <code>primKey</code> is the primary key of the company
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * Group scope - <code>primKey</code> is the primary key of the group the
 * permission applies within
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * Group-template scope - <code>primKey</code> is always <code>0</code>
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * Individual scope - If the permission applies to a model instance,
 * <code>primkey</code> will be the primary key of the instance. If the
 * permission is for a portlet, <code>primKey</code> will contain the primary
 * key of the layout containing the portlet, followed by &quot;_LAYOUT_&quot;
 * and the portlet ID. The instance ID will also be present for instanceable
 * portlets, preceded by &quot;_INSTANCE_&quot;.
 * </li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>
 * The <code>actionIds</code> attribute stores the bitwise IDs of all the
 * actions allowed by this permission.
 * </p>
